# Acknowledgements

I am grateful to Clovis Grinand, Romuald Vaudry and Matthieu Tiberghien who gave me the opportunity to work on deforestation modeling when we were leading forest conservation projects in Madagascar. I also warmly thank Frédéric Achard and all the members of the IFORCE group for their invaluable support during the first phase of development of the package while I was seconded to the JRC in Ispra. This work benefited from funding by FRB-FFEM (BioSceneMada project, AAP-SCEN-2013 I), the European Commission (Roadless Forest project) and CNRT (RELIQUES project).
